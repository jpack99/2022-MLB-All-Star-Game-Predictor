Random Forest Model to predict selections to 2022 MLB All-Star Game
All data taken from baseball-reference.com
Predictor Data accurate as of 6/23/2022.  Ignoring current injuries affecting availability, strictly predicting who should be selected to the All-Star Game.
Also tried creating XGBoost model, but got best performance from Random Forest.
Model is very dependent on OPS+.  Would be interesting to re-do analysis using wRC+.
